      <h2>Hi There. I'm happy you are here!</h2>
      <p>Thank you taking a moment out of your day to stop by and visit. It means a lot!
        <br> So why did I build this page that resembles something out of the early 2000's?
        <br> Well this website is to serve as a monument and a reflection of my successes along my codeing journey.
        <br> As my ability grows, so too will this website grow and become more stylized and polished.
        <br> So far I only have three pages you can visit, but that is going to quickly change.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Take Up Coding?</h2>
      <p>I am determined to possess a valuable skill-set to develop tools and resources that treats the users privacy and protection as a top priority.
        <br> I aim to help re-define what ethical modes of data harvesting and handling, looks like in the near future.
        <br> I will help design a set of checks and balances, that have the industry more proactive in asking themselves the more important questions like:<em><strong> "Should</strong> We Do it?"</em>, instead of "Can We Do It?".
